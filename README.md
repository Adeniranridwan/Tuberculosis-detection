# Tuberculosis-detection

# Problem Statement:
Tuberculosis (TB) is a life-threatening infectious disease caused by the Mycobacterium tuberculosis bacteria, primarily affecting the lungs but potentially spreading to other parts of the body. Early and accurate diagnosis is crucial for timely treatment and controlling its spread. However, existing diagnostic methods are often slow, expensive, or inaccessible in low-resource settings. This creates a pressing need for efficient, affordable, and scalable detection solutions.

# Objectives:

Develop a system or methodology to detect tuberculosis accurately using clinical data, imaging (e.g., chest X-rays), or molecular tests.
Ensure that the detection method is cost-effective and scalable for deployment in low-resource environments.
Aim for high sensitivity and specificity to minimize false negatives and false positives.

# Key Challenges:
**Data Quality:** Obtaining labeled datasets of chest X-rays, gene expressions, or clinical reports for TB patients can be challenging, especially in underrepresented regions.
**Resource Constraints:** The solution must work effectively in areas with limited medical infrastructure, ensuring minimal dependency on expensive equipment or highly trained personnel.
**False Diagnoses:** Misdiagnosis can lead to severe consequences, either through unnecessary treatment (false positives) or untreated progression (false negatives).

# Image-Based Detection:
Develop a machine learning model, such as a convolutional neural network (CNN), trained on labeled chest X-ray datasets to identify TB-specific patterns.
Include data augmentation techniques to enhance robustness.

Create mobile applications that use cloud-based AI models to analyze uploaded X-rays or clinical parameters.
Design portable, affordable diagnostic devices for field testing.

# Evaluation Metrics:
Sensitivity (True Positive Rate): Ability to detect TB-positive cases correctly.
Specificity (True Negative Rate): Ability to identify TB-negative cases correctly.
Accuracy: Overall performance across all test samples.
